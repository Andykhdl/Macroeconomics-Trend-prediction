# Macroeconomics-Trend-prediction
# General Description
 This study aims to utilise advanced data analytics methodologies to predict forthcoming
 economic trends with high accuracy. Employing a neural network model trained on an extensive
 array of economic variables, this research endeavours to produce robust prognostications
 concerning future economic landscapes. The overarching objective is to furnish comprehensive
 and intelligible insights to facilitate proactive decision-making among business entities and
 policymakers. This, in turn, will contribute to enhancing economic stability and resilience in the
 face of anticipated fluctuations and transformations.

# Purpose
